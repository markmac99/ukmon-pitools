=========================================

The code here is used to upload data from GMN / RMS cameras to the UK Meteor Network 
in realtime to our livestream, and to send detailed analytical data to our archive 
for inclusion in our data processing pipeline.  You can see the livestream here 
https://ukmeteornetwork.co.uk/live/#/

Data sent to the archive is included in orbit and trajectory solving, the
results of which can be viewed here. https://archive.ukmeteornetwork.co.uk/
